/**
 * Consent queries — the publication gate (issues #38 and #84, Epics #3 and
 * #12).
 *
 * `isPublishable` below is THE single entry point for publication
 * eligibility. Any publication path (Proof API in Epic #14, proof library in
 * Epic #13, review responses in Epic #10, GBP placement) that does not call
 * it is a bug. There is no `is_publishable` boolean anywhere — eligibility
 * is computed at read time from append-only `consents` rows. See
 * packages/db/CONSENT.md and the "Publication checks" section of
 * CONTRIBUTING.md.
 *
 * These wrappers are thin on purpose: every decision and every row shape is
 * produced by the pure functions in `@wellregarded/core` (`checkConsent`,
 * `grantConsent`, `revokeConsent` in `src/consent/`); this module only adds
 * the fetch and the transaction.
